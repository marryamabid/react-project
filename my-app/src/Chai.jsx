        Learned About Some Best Practices Using React Name the component
        capitalize e.g App.js We can name both App.js & App.jsx in create React but in vite
        development environment we have to use jsx We can return only one
        component by a jsx function so it's good to wrap in <></> or <div></div>
        Created our own component Chai.jsx rendered successfully
      </p>

export default Chai;
